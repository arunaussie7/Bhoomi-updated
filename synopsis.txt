                           PROJECT SYNOPSIS
                    SMART ATS RESUME ANALYZER SYSTEM
                        Academic Year: 2024-25

1. TITLE OF THE PROJECT
=======================
Smart ATS Resume Analyzer - An Intelligent Web-Based Resume Optimization System

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
====================
In the current job market, over 75% of resumes are filtered out by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before reaching human recruiters. Many qualified candidates are rejected due to poor keyword optimization, lack of ATS-friendly formatting, and limited feedback on resume effectiveness. There is a lack of accessible, intelligent tools that help job seekers analyze and optimize their resumes for specific job descriptions and ATS requirements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
=====================================

Objectives:
- To develop a web-based system that analyzes resumes for ATS compatibility.
- To provide real-time feedback and actionable recommendations for improvement.
- To generate a compatibility score and identify missing keywords/skills.
- To offer an intuitive interface for non-technical users.

Scope:
- PDF resume text extraction and analysis.
- Job description compatibility scoring.
- Missing keyword identification and improvement suggestions.
- Multi-page web interface with session management.
- Real-time analysis and visualization.

Out of Scope:
- Resume formatting/template generation.
- Batch processing and user account management.
- Direct integration with external ATS systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. METHODOLOGY
==============
- User uploads a PDF resume and enters a job description via the web interface.
- The system extracts text from the PDF using PyPDF2.
- Text is preprocessed and formatted into a prompt for AI analysis.
- Google Generative AI analyzes the prompt and returns a structured JSON response.
- The system parses the response, calculates a compatibility score, and identifies missing keywords.
- Results and recommendations are displayed interactively to the user.
- Session state is used for persistent navigation and data sharing between pages.
- Error handling and validation are implemented at each stage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
